It is a form of individual based representation which is agnostic (ie. It can be anything which believes there is a higher power)

Key aspects of ABM is
- Agents - decision making behavior, interactions, perception
- Environment - States, dynamics

### Model Exexution
- Install Gama and create a new gama project
- Import the shape files of buildings, bounds and roads from the library modela
- Drag and drop the shape file into your project
- Implement the model with species and reflexes
- Once the model is ready, run the simulation
